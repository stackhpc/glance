option, and the 'os_hash_value' will be populated by the hexdigest computed

the 'hashlib.algorithms_available' data member of the version of the

purposes, however, we recommend that you use the set of secure hash
names supplied by the 'hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed' data member because
those algorithms are guaranteed to be supported by the 'hashlib' library
