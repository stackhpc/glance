    Images in the qcow2 format with an external data file are now
    rejected from glance because such images could be used in an
    exploit to expose host information. See `Bug #2059809
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/+bug/2059809>`_ for details.

    `Bug #2059809 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/+bug/2059809>`_:
    Fixed issue where a qcow2 format image with an external data file
    could expose host information. Such an image format with an external
    data file will be rejected from glance. To achieve the same,
    format_inspector has been extended by adding safety checks for qcow2
    and vmdk files in glance. Unsafe qcow and vmdk files will be rejected
    by pre-examining them with a format inspector to ensure safe
    configurations prior to any qemu-img operations.
