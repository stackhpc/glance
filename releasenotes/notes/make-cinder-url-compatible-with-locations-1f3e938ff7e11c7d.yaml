    `Bug #2054575 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/+bug/2054575>`_:
    Fixed the issue when cinder uploads a volume to glance in the
    optimized path and glance rejects the request with invalid location.
    Now we convert the old location format sent by cinder into the new
    location format supported by multi store, hence allowing volumes to
    be uploaded in an optimized way.
